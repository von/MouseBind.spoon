--- === MouseBind ===
--- Allows binding mouse actions to functions. Requires access to the Mac accessibility
--- stack to work as described in http://www.hammerspoon.org/faq/
--- Allows binding to any events described in hs.eventtap.event.types which is actually
--- more than mouse events, but it's not intended to replace hs.hotkey, which is
--- more effective for binding to key presses.

--- MouseBind:debug(enable)
--- Method
--- Enable or disable debugging
---
--- Parameters:
---  * enable - Boolean indicating whether debugging should be on
---
--- Returns:
---  * Nothing
function MouseBind:debug(enable)
  if enable then
    self.log.setLogLevel('debug')
    self.log.d("Debugging enabled")
  else
    self.log.d("Disabling debugging")
    self.log.setLogLevel('info')
  end
  self.MouseBinding:debug(enable)
end

-- Methods
-- Spoon methods/variables/constants/etc. should use camelCase

--- MouseBind:init()
--- Method
--- Initializes a MouseBind
--- When a user calls hs.loadSpoon(), Hammerspoon will load and execute init.lua
--- from the relevant s.
--- Do generally not perform any work, map any hotkeys, start any timers/watchers/etc.
--- in the main scope of your init.lua. Instead, it should simply prepare an object
--- with methods to be used later, then return the object.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * MouseBind object

function MouseBind:init()
  -- Set up logger for spoon
  self.log = hs.logger.new("MouseBind")

  -- Path to this file itself
  -- See also http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.spoons.html#resourcePath
  self.path = hs.spoons.scriptPath()

  -- List of bindings
  self.bindings = {}

  -- MouseBinding class
  self.MouseBinding = dofile(self.path.."/MouseBinding.lua")

  return self
end

--start() and stop()
--If your Spoon provides some kind of background activity, e.g. timers, watchers,
--spotlight searches, etc. you should generally activate them in a :start()
--method, and de-activate them in a :stop() method

--- MouseBind:start()
--- Method
--- Start background activity.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * param - Some parameter
---
--- Returns:
---  * MouseBind object
function MouseBind:start()
  -- No-op
  return self
end

--- MouseBind:stop()
--- Method
--- Stop background activity.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * param - Some parameter
---
--- Returns:
---  * MouseBind object
function MouseBind:stop()
  hs.fnutils.map(self.bindings, function(b) b:disable() end)
  return self
end

--- MouseBind:createBinding()
--- Method
--- Create a new binding between a mouse event and an action. Returns a
--- MouseBinding object.
--- This is a wrapper around MouseBinding.new():enable()
---
--- Parameters:
---  * mods - A table or a string containing (as elements, or as substrings with any
---    separator) the keyboard modifiers required, which should be zero or more of the
---    following:
---      "cmd", "command" or "⌘"
---      "ctrl", "control" or "⌃"
---      "alt", "option" or "⌥"
---      "shift" or "⇧"
---  * typeName - A string containing the name of an event type, as described in
---    hs.eventtap.event.types
---  * message - A string containing a message to be displayed via hs.alert()
---    when the mouse event has been triggered; if nil, no alert will be shown
---    Note that unlike hs.hotkey, this parameter must be present.
---  * fn - A function that will be called when mouse event is detected.
---
--- Returns:
---  *  MouseBinding istance.
function MouseBind:createBinding(mods, typeName, message, fn)
  local b = self.MouseBinding.new(mods, typeName, message, fn)
  if b then
    table.insert(self.bindings, b)
    b:enable()
  end
  return b
end

--- MouseBind:debugEvents()
--- Method
--- Log all events. Intended for debugging.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * enable   boolean indicating if logging should be started or stopped.
---
--- Returns:
---  * Nothing
function MouseBind:debugEvents(enable)
  -- Shut down any prior debugging
  if self.debugLog then
    self.debugLog = nil
  end
  if self.debugTap then
    self.debugTap:stop()
    self.debugTap = nil
  end
  -- And reenable if called for
  if enable then
    self.debugLog = hs.logger.new("DebugEvents", "verbose")
    self.debugTap = hs.eventtap.new({"all"},
      function(event)
        self.debugLog.d(hs.eventtap.event.types[event:getType()])
        return false -- Propagate event
      end)
    self.debugTap:start()
    hs.timer.doAfter(30, function() self.debugTap:stop() end) -- DEBUG
  end
end

--- MouseBind:dragWindowExample()
--- Function
--- Example callback that lets one move a window by using a modifier key with a mouse
--- drag event. Usage:
--- MouseBind: createBinding({"alt"}, "leftMouseDragged", nil, MouseBind.dragWindowExample)
---
--- Parameters:
---  * event - hs.eventtap.event instance
---
--- Returns:
---  * delete - a boolean, true if the event should be deleted, false if it should
---    propagate to any other applications watching for that event.
---  * events - Optional table of events to post.
function MouseBind.dragWindowExample(event)
  local deltax = event:getProperty(hs.eventtap.event.properties.mouseEventDeltaX)
  local deltay = event:getProperty(hs.eventtap.event.properties.mouseEventDeltaY)
  local win = hs.window.frontmostWindow()
  if win then
    win:move(hs.geometry.point(deltax, deltay))
  end
  return true  -- Don't propagate the event
end

return MouseBind
